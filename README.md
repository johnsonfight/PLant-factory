# Plant-factory
This is the controller of the plant factory which can control the temperature, humidity, concentration of carbon dioxide and light intensity in the environment.
We take a Arduino UNO as our microcontroller to control the acuators and sensor.
The acuators include heater for heating up, compressor and fan for cooling down also dehumidifying, ultra sonic humidfier for humidifying, cylinder and relay for adding carbon dioxide, fluorescent lamp for the light intensity.
The sensor is 3 in 1 temperature, humidity, concentration of carbon dioxide sensor.
After sending the target data sets to the controller, the controller can track these data, controlling these environment factors precisely.
